# Credit Risk Classification

## Credit Risk Analysis Report
The purpose of this analysis is to explore credit data in order to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a loan will be healthy or high-risk.

## The Results
* Model 1
     * Balanced Accuracy Report: 95.20%
     * Precision
            * Healthy Loans: 100%
            * High-Risk Loans: 85%
     * Recall
            * Healthy Loans: 99%
            * High-Risk Loans: 91%
* Model 2
     * Balanced Accuracy Report: 99.37%
     * Precision
            * Healthy Loans: 100%
            * High-Risk Loans: 84%
     * Recall
            * Healthy Loans: 99%
            * High-Risk Loans: 99%

## Summary
I would recommend the second machine learning model because despite losing 1% of the precision when predicting high-risk loans, this model yields a much better recall for high-risk loans. This means that in losing 1% of its predictive ability, this model gains 8% in its ability to detect the category of high-risk loans.
